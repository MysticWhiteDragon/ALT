	<h1>Welcome</h1>
	<h2>*** Google Chrome recommended ***</h2>
	<p>The pages to be printed are best viewed in Google Chrome.  You may have to adjust the paper size for printing.  I have listed the size of the sheets that I used so it can be printed correctly.  I plan on making changes as time permits to allow to make it even easier.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>This is were I will put English teaching materials that I have created for your use.  Feel free to use them as you wish.</p>
	<p>This is a work in progress.  So, somethings may not look or work properly.  I'll be workinig on them when I have a chance.</p>
	<h3>Feb. 1st, 2019 - Update</h3>
	<p>Can now open and save the certificate information on your PC.  You will still need to visit this site to use it though.  I will change it later if possible so that it can be saved as a file that Microsoft Word can use.</p>
